# Automation Framework

### Technical

This framework uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Cucumber] - BDD style support for testing on Java!
* [JUnit 4&5] - Test runner tool of Java
* [Selenium] - Library use for interacting with Web Browser.
* [WebDriverManager] - Controlling the driver for each browser in the machine

### Installation

Ensure JDK 1.8 and Maven has been installed
```
brew install maven
```


### How to run

**For Cucumber Test**
```sh
$ mvn clean verify -Dtest="RunCucumberTest" test -Denv=[environment] -Dlocation=[location] "-Dcucumber.options=--tags \"[tagName]\"" 
```

Run automation for web
```sh
mvn clean verify -Dtest="RunCucumberTest" -Denv=dev -Dcucumber.options="--tags @web" test
```

[tagName] = @ tag name  e.g. @smoke, @regression, @web...

### Structure
**MAIN**
- `main.java.page_object`: contains all **Page Object Classes** of web platform
- `main.java.utils`: contains all **Utilities Classes**, such as Driver Factory, Driver Utils, Selenium Custom Element, Environment Configuration...
- `main.java.resources`: contains the **Environment Configuration** files (.properties) for dev, staging, prod...

**TEST**
- `test.java.stepdefs`: where define **Methods of Cucumber Gherkin steps** https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/step-definitions/. Define Cucumber hooks - `CustomHook` (before, after methods or specific cucumber tags ) & Cucumber Running Class - `RunCucumberTest` with JUnit.
- `test.java.resources:` The directory `features` stores all **Test Scenarios**.

**Pom.xml**: It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. It contains default values for most projects (plugins, dependencies/libraries, properties, profile, environment variables...)

### How to define a Web/Mobile Element in PageObject Class
Please use this pattern:
```
@FindBy(locator)
[Access Modifier] [?static] WebElement [ElementName];
```
Examples for Web Element: use **Element** type or specific elements as So  and should be `public static`
```
@FindBy(id = "email")
public static WebElement Email_Textbox;
```

#### Utilities Classes

- **Factory**: Manage drivers for web
- **Selenium**: Create specific types of inteface **Element**
- **Environment**: Handle application configuration via Java properties files

### Test Case Template
**Features** (stories) are explained using agile framework on user stories.
- Feature can contain one or more scenarios.
- Feature group contains locally related test scenarios.
- Feature represents small, discrete features of the system.
- Feature files start with keyword Feature, followed by feature name/terse description of feature.

**Scenario**: the name for the behavior that will be described with following keywords:
- `Given` some precondition
- `When` I do some action
- `Then` I expect some result

**Note**: Each acceptance criteria written in this format has the following statements:
- `Given` – the beginning state of the scenario
- `When` – specific action that the user makes
- `Then` – the outcome of the action in “When”
- `And` – used to continue any of three previous statements

#### Examples:
**Web Steps:**
```
I open web browser
```


### Assertion
Functions of `AssertJ` library are used in verifying steps (`Then`).
Static import:
```
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;
```
Example:
```
assertThat(HomePage.Page_Title.getText()).isEqualTo(PageName);
```

In some concrete cases, using `Soft Assertions` to collects all assertion errors instead of stopping at the first one.

### Test Report
The Cucumber test report will be generated by using report plugin and defined at @CucumberOptions in `step_defs.RunCucumberTest`

**In Local:**
Use lifecycle `verify` instead of `test` to generate test report in directory `target/cucumber-html-reports/js/`
The main report is file `overview-features.html`
*Example:* Run this command to execute all scenarios which have tag "@regression" and generate the test report:
```
mvn clean verify -Denv=dev "-Dcucumber.options=--tags \"@web\""
```
